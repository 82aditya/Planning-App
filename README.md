# Planning-App

An app to help you track your learning journey. It have custom roadmap or guideline to keep you on track. There is also assignment or goals as a milestone or sign of your skill completeness. Faithful to its name, this is not just learning plan app, but also have simple financial notes. Hopefully, in the future, this app will add more planning tools, such a diet calculator or workout schedule.
